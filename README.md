## Introduction / Business Problem

Colombo is the commercial capital and largest city of Sri Lanka by population. According to the Brookings Institution, Colombo metropolitan area has a population of 5.6 million, and 752,993 in the city proper. It is the financial center of the island and a tourist destination. Colombo is arguably Sri Lanka's most popular tourist destination. The coastal city is a beautiful place to spend a couple of days just relaxing, indulging in the local food, and leisure activities. In Colombo, most common restaurants are aimed at tourists, with a mix of Sri Lankan, seafood and Western dishes and South Indian-style places.
Our stakeholder is willing to open a restaurant in Colombo. Choosing a restaurant type and a good spot, relies on common sense and domain knowledge. Data science provides valuable insights regarding market trends and consumer lifestyles so that stakeholder can better address and meet public demand.
In this project, we will implement the basic analysis and try to find the most optimal sub-urbs to open the restaurant according to those criteria. It's obvious, that there are many additional factors, such as distance from parking places or distance from the main streets, but this analysis mainly focuses on the type of restaurants
